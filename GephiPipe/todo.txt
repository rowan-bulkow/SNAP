Gephi Pipe Update Todo List:

- take output path as an input
- update build.sh to reflect this ^^^
- fix layouts: 0, 1, 3 (i.e., only Yifan Hu works...)
- update build.sh to run all layouts from test-input dir?
- make build.sh easier to use... (the point was to simplify cmd line experience)
- delete all the old, commented out code
- convert AutoGephiPipe, the static class monstrosity, into GephiPipe, the regular monster?
- generate a few full sets of each layout with old and new code, as verification
- update readme, both in GephiPipe, and in assets/GephiPipe
- hook up to php
